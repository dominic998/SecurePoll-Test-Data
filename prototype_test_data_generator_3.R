## This is a slight improvement and generalisation of the first
## prototype. Compared to the first:
## 1. It handles any number of candidates.
## 2. It can simulate any of the candidates 2 to N reallocating votes to
##    candidate 1.
## 3. It simulates one candidate being eliminated from the election (if
##    applicable).

## @param preferences: Output of expand.grid(a:b, c:d, e:f, g:h, ...) which is a
##        dataframe each row of which is a different combination of votes.

##        If there are N candidates, the columns 1 to N contain the number of
##        first preferences for candidates 1 to N respectively.

##        The columns N+1 <= N+i <= 2*N contain the number of voters who chose
##        candidate i as first and candidate 1 as second.

##        Selecting a good preferences argument is a bit of an art-form, some
##        examples are below.

## @param numStages: Number of stages of the election to simulate.

## @param numCandidates: Number of candidates in this election.

## @param numSeats: Number of seats in this election.
